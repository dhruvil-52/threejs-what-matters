2. 3D Modeling & Animation
   Blender/3ds Max/Maya: Learn how to create 3D models and animations using professional software.
   Exporting Models: Understand how to export models in formats compatible with web technologies (e.g., GLTF, OBJ, FBX).
3. 3D Graphics Concepts
   Mesh: The basic building block of 3D objects.
   Textures & Materials: Learn how to apply images and properties to 3D models to make them look realistic.
   Lighting: Understand how to set up different types of lights to illuminate your 3D scenes.
   Camera & Perspective: Learn how to control the camera to create dynamic views and animations.
   Animations: Create and export animations that can be triggered in the browser.
4. Shaders
   GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language): Learn how to write custom shaders to control the appearance of 3D objects (e.g., lighting effects, textures).
   Shader Libraries: Explore libraries like ShaderToy for inspiration and ready-made shaders.
5. Performance Optimization
   Level of Detail (LOD): Reduce the complexity of 3D models based on the viewer's distance.
   Culling: Techniques like frustum culling to improve rendering performance by not drawing objects outside the cameraâ€™s view.
   Optimization Tools: Use tools to optimize assets and ensure smooth performance (e.g., Draco compression for GLTF models).
6. Interactivity
   Raycasting: Learn how to detect interactions with 3D objects.
   Physics Engines: Use physics libraries (e.g., Cannon.js, Ammo.js) to add realistic motion and collisions.
7. Animation Libraries
   GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Powerful library for creating high-performance animations, including 3D animations.
   Anime.js: Lightweight library for creating animations that can work alongside 3D libraries.
8. 3D File Formats
   GLTF/GLB: Widely used formats for 3D models on the web, optimized for WebGL.
   OBJ/FBX: Common 3D file formats supported by many 3D modeling tools.
9. WebXR
   Virtual & Augmented Reality: Learn how to create immersive 3D experiences that work with VR/AR devices.
